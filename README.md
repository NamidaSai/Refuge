# Refuge
 Juice Off - 72h Game Jam - Restriction "No Violence"
 
 A meditative rythm game on a sparse melody.


Game Jam - JUICE OFF!
There was one called Comfy. He organised the mightiest of battle between Youtube Game Developers. It was called the Infinity War of Game Devs round 1. Or, as we like to call it, the JUICE OFF. The goal? Make the juiciest game of them all. The rules? No Violence allowed.

Short Description
When I heard about the restriction, I thought I would not only use it as a constraint but also as a theme to inspire the context of the game. I soon decided I would make a game about a cute tiny monk. Would it be a platformer? A puzzle game? I've done those before... So no: I decided to do something I hadn't, I went with a rhythm game.

And since I don't like doing anything easy, instead of going for a song that has a regular beat and constant movement, I went for a very sparse and meditative Guqin (7-stringed traditional chinese instrument) piece. This forced me to try and map every note of the melody to the game. It's not perfect on that side, but I'm happy with how it turned out mood-wise. 

It's called Refuge because I wanted to pay tribute to the Tibetan unrest and struggle against the Chinese government. It's also to remind us to appreciate those moments of peace wherever we find them, for those who cannot find any.

Let me know what you think!
